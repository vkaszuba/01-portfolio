        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
        <img class="bioImage" src="assets/images/pic-me.jpg">
        <p>A first generation Polish-American, walking high-fantasy Encyclopedia, and parent to two Siamese cats. I've been all over the world, and worked in most every industry on it. I first began drawing when young, and that took me into teaching myself how to use Photoshop in high school, which then pushed me to college to follow my ambition to create the very video games I loved playing.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>I have so many interests on so many spectrums; I'm a writer of short stories and poetry, I create art both on paper and digitally, both 2D and 3D, I've managed teams and prepared interns for their entire career, I've built upon old tech (EverQuest) and new (Virtual Reality). I feel as if I've done everything, though what I've always felt was my calling, is coding. The instances where I was able to manipulate products in previous art roles via CSS and Python left me chasing more. There's not a feeling that even comes close to what creating code that works feels like; it's the ultimate challenge without a shortage of new problems to solve, and I'm not one to back down from a dare.
