Week 1 & 2 Homework

## Introduction
My first project, implementing the basics of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
This is a portfolio with an About Me page, a Portfolio page that showcases my previous work, a Resume page, and a Contact form page.

My inspiration was a simplistic and clean design, with my logo as the background to minimize additional noise. I added slashes next to the navigation options to call-back to how comments are added into JavaScript files. Although difficult to maintain, I wanted to keep a side-bar nav to create a drastic shift in design between small and large screens. 

## Status
The build is fully functional, and tested on every screen size.

## Implementation List
- Basic HTML built out
- CSS file added, all HTML elements have custom changes
- Contact form PHP file added
- Images for About Me, background, and Portfolio page uploaded
- Header and footer content added, with social media links
- Side navbar created and linked to all additional pages
- Applying header, footer, and nav bar to all pages, for a seamless design
- Bootstrap conversion implemented
- Media Query CSS file created
- Responsive navbar created, switching from side bar to an icon on smaller screen sizes

## Work in Progress
- Contact form isn't fully functional
- Add button for a downloadable version of Resume
- Full-size version of Profile art upon clicking on thumbnail
- JavaScript has not been used yet
